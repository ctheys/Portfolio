        <p>We have observed that the current website design is not meeting this goal because of a lack of trust in the website leading to poor support for animals. How might we design the website in such a way that the present information helps users to connect with the organization to promote user retention.</p>
        <br>
        <h6 class="title">The Solution</h6>
        <p>We believe that if we organise the information within the website in a more structural and professional manner, it will lead to an increased trust in the organisation and therefore will help the cause.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">1 User Research</h2>
      <p><i>User interviews and surveys, Competitor analysis, Heuristic Evaluation</i></p>
    </div>  

    <div class="part1Txt">
      <p>Research to redesign the non-profit website was done by conducting user interviews & competitor analysis. We developed Interview questions by researching what a user may need or want to feel more connected to the website and in turn the cause. We conducted 5 semi-structured interviews face to face and via zoom. We also conducted a survey via google forms.</p>  
      <p class=txtHighlight>Key findings from the user interview were:
        <br>
        <br>
        - The purpose of the website was unclear leading to lack of trust for the users.
        <br>
        - Too many typographic and design styles on one page made the website look unprofessional and hard to read.
        <br>
        - Overloaded menu confused users.
        <br>
        - Poor visual design of the website did not inspire any emotions in the user.
        <br>
        - The information on the website was not properly organised.
      <br>
      </p>
      <p>The user research revealed that  people were not willing to support the cause because the website did not look professional or trustworthy. This was due to an outdated design and glitches in the current website, including poor organisation of the website content leading to the user feeling overwhelmed and detached to the cause. Therefore, we believe that if the information on the website is organized in a more accessible manner with a focus on a more visually appealing design it might be able to help people feel connected to the cause.
        We examined the interface of both the home page and the adopt a pet page and judged its compliance with recognised usability principles using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 general principales for interaction design. </p>

      <p>We also performed a competitor analysis as below:</p>

      <p><i>User Persona & Journey Map, Storyboard</i></p>
    </div> 
    
    <div class="part2Txt">
      <p>We defined an archetype, that is a representation of a group of users, with their motivations, behaviours and fears. This tool is designed to help us during all the design process to remember the users’ goals.</p>

      <img src="../Portfolio/images/APWF/User persona.png" alt="User Persona" class="persona" width="50%">

      <p>We then made a storyboard to validate the goals and found opportunities to develop solutions that resolved Samantha’s needs.</p>

      <p><i>User Flow, Sketch & Wireframe</i></p>
    </div>  
    

    <div class="part3Txt">
      <p>Before we started sketching and building out wireframes, we wanted to figure out what the user flows would look like for users trying to accomplish specific tasks. 
        The three tasks chosen were the donation page, about us and adopt or surrender and would highlight the main feature functions of the website.</p>
      
      <img src="../Portfolio/images/APWF/userFlow.png" alt="User Flow" class="userFlow" width="50%">

      <p>The next step following the creation of the user flow maps was to start sketching wireframes. Before we made digital wireframes, we all drew up quick sketches showing some of the key screens that we would need to build out when creating the app. Creating sketches first helped us visualize our ideas as well as gave us the basic structure for how users would use the app. Next we built wireframes on figma keeping the user needs from our persona, empathy map and research in mind. We decided to keep the wireframes low fidelity by not incorporating UI elements in order to get more valuable, valid, and actionable user inputs for the app without having branding play a key factor in the process.</p>

        <p>We decided to use a warmer colour palette for the website to make it feel more welcoming.  Doing this will allow our users to easily access important information on the website leading to more people supporting the cause.</p>

      </div>  
    
      <div class="part5Txt">
        <p>We conducted usability testing with the users to identify pain points and issues in the website redesign.  The users were asked to perform the tasks listed below:
        <br>
        <br>
           Task 1: Can user donate $78.00 monthy via paypal
           <br>
           Task 2: You want to adopt a pet from a shelter. Can user find the closest shelters from Brisbane?
           <br>
           Task 3: Can user go back to the home page from adopting a pet page
           <br>
           <br>
            
            
           During the usability test, users are asked to verbalise their thoughts. Follow up questions such as “why” and “tell me more about that” were asked to get users to elaborate on their thought process. The usability test sessions were also video recorded for documentary purposes.
            
           Iterations made from the results of the usability test are below:</p>

      <div class="part6Txt">
        <p>This was a really exciting and fun project for us. We didn’t get much from the initial user interviews and realised how important it is to find the right participants for the study. And this is why we had to perform the usability test twice. We also learned the importance of good information architecture and the effects of colour on the user.</p>
